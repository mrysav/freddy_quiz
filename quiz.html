<!-- For this assignment, you will creating the shell of a quiz.
     It should include:
       1. A title (probably as a header tag)
       2. A description of the quiz under the header
       3. At least 3 questions.

     Each question should have the question text and four options as answers.
     You can design the tags around the question any way you want, as long as it has the 
     question text and four answers.

     In order to make the answers you will need what's called a "radio button."
     Radio buttons allow the user to choose exactly one option from a group of options.
     That looks like this:
     <input class="answer" type="radio" name="group1" value="a">Cow<br>
     There are 3 attributes:
       - type: the type of input, in this case, 'radio' for radio button.
       - name: the name of the group of buttons. Users can only select one option from each group of options.
               (each question will have multiple <input class="answer"> tags, with one group name per question)
       - value: the value of the input, hidden from the user, but this is what the HTML page sees as the value of the answer.

     You can paste the example into the HTML below to experiment and see what it looks like.
